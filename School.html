<p>Student athletes have many practices and games which leads to a busy life.</p> 
</div>
<div>
<p>Being a student athlete myself and having to play three sports a year, I had to miss a lot of class time due to the fact that I had many away games. Being said college athletes have a lot of away games,therefore they are always traveling,and in some scenarios they are going out of state</p> 
</div>
<div>
<p>According to bussinessoutsider.com,"In the study, Division I men’s basketball players reported spending 34 hours per week on athletics. FBS football players reported spending 42 hours per week on athletic activities—a full-time job."</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Student athletes are basically balancing a full time job with school and yet they are not payed I dont see the justice in that. </p>

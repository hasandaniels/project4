<p>The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is an organization which regulates athletes of 1,281 institutions and conferences.Last year the NCAA made 1.06 billion dollars off of college sports.</p> 
</div>
<div>
<p>The NCAA makes a billion dollars every year. $824 million dollars comes from college football and basketball. There is enough money to give each student a small salary. </p> 
</div>
<div>
<p>I am not saying pay them 6 figures, but give them some money so that they can give back to their families or take care of some of their expenses that they may have while in college.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paying student athletes could also increase winning percentages. Certain bonuses and small paychecks might influence your players to go on their respective playing grounds and give it their all and it will end up making college sports more interesting.</p>
